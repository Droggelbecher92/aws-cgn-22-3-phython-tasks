# Last FizzBuzz Challenge, I promise! You can use the logic from the other tasks, but if you want to train, start from scratch :)
# Write two functions:
#   - the first will fizzbuss from 1-100 without an argument
#   - the second will take one number as an argubent, to check for a fizzbuzz
#BOUNS:
#   - The function gets two argument, a starting number and a final number. Do the fizzbuzz for every number in this range.
