# Your own shop


Create a file with a Python script that does the following:

- Prints out a ‚Äúbanner‚Äù to welcome users to our shop
- Asks the user for the name of the item they are buying
- Asks the user for the price of that item
- Asks the user for the quantity they are purchasing
- Prints out a message that includes their subtotal (quantity ùö° price)

Example output
```
WELCOME TO OUR USELESS STORE!
*****************************
what item are you purchasing?  taco
what is the price of taco?  2.5
how many taco are you buying?  5
 
Added 5 taco(s) to shopping cart
Subtotal: $12.5
```

- Make sure to convert user input to numbers when needed!
- Use an f-strings when printing out the final total (goole is your friend)
